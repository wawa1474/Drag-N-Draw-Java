/*
redo how context switching is done
  make a menu system

redo tile map system
  allow multiple tile maps at once
  redo how they are shown and used by user
  change tile image changing to somehow free up mouse wheel

make "tool" system
  recolor tool (currently right-click) would be a selectable tool
  place tile (currently left-click) would be a selectable tool
  place color tile (currently middle-click) would be a selectable tool
  anything else? group selection maybe instead of a button?

use a pallette based color system to compress color data?
  256 or 65536 color pallette

for icons have a settable color (16 colors?)
  and maybe make it so there's no color border?

Try loading tile map based on name
if that fails try loading by location
if that fails throw error
